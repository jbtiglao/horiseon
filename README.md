# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

As first class assignment, we were tasked to refactor Horiseon, a mock-up web page. We are given a starter code that needs to be modifed in order to make it more accessible.


## The Mock-Up

Below is an image of the Horiseon webpage with its header, navigation bar, header image, main content with images and text, side bar with icons and text, and footer.

The web page has links that don't work or "jump" to the relevant content when clicked. The images and icons need proper descriptors while the HTML and CSS files need to be improved for efficiency and maximum accessibility.





## This Version

In this new version of the mock-up, the HTML and CSS files are improved, structured, and properly commented for accessibility using a screen reader or other accessibility tools and assistive technology. Meta tags for description and keywords are added to the HTML code to optimize search engine results. 

The semantic HTML elements are properly named and follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. The icon and image elements are given clear, accessible alt attributes. The heading attributes fall in sequential order, while the title element has a concise and descriptive title. 

All application link function correctly and "jump" to relevant content when clicked. The title and navigation links change color on hover. Clicking the title opens an About page (that is yet to be made)-- for the purpose of showing the title has been fixed and links to a page about Horiseon. 

The letters SEO in the title, which also stands for Self Engine Optimization, are changed to a darker shade of gray to give more emphasis to the letters or abbreviation.

The content containers and sidebar are fixed to have the same height while its width are made to fit the page.

The efficiency of the CSS is increased by consolidating the selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page. Meanwhile, redundant elements, selectors, and properties are either deleted or fixed with a different name, id, or class. 

With all the improvement, the application still resembles the mock-up shown above and provided in the homework instructions (at least 90%).
